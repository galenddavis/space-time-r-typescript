# Space-time(r)

As a person who can tend towards distraction whenever something captures my attention, I often find myself using pomodoro timers in order keep to a work schedule. I currently have a go-to that I use, but I feel like there's usually some functionality that I want beyond the simple timer. I usually work with music on in the background and I figured, why not try to integrate that. I have a list of playlists of ambient spacey music that I work to, and if I could consolodate these two perpetually open tabs into one unified one, all the better. 

This is also my learning project for React Hooks and as I built out the functionality, I got a much better sense for how they can replace the old Class components I was used to. 

## Functionality

There are three main functionalities for this project:

1. Timer with work duration, short break, and a long break.
2. Music functionality pulling from youtube. 
3. Task List for keeping track of current and past tasks. 

## Technologies Used

* React(.js) (Hooks)
* Node(.js)
* Express(.js)
* Node(.js)
* MongoDB
* SASS
